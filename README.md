# Don't have a fear of pull requests

This project takes inspiration from evildmp/afraid-to-commit, acting as a safe
place to try out the creation of pull requests. Other than not being as
complete, the only reason for this version is to focus specifically on being a
place to practice contributing via github pull requests.

## Aims

follow the instructions below:
